# 🌌 AURA — AI Unified Rewriting & Analysis

AURA is a plagiarism-detection assistant (with rewrite guidance) built with **FastAPI** (backend) and **Streamlit** (frontend).  
This repository contains the backend FastAPI service and the Streamlit UI. The backend uses embedding-based similarity (sentence-transformers) to detect semantic plagiarism.
